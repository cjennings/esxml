Read Me

This library was created to fascilitate quickly building web pages, though it
also includes tools for working with parsed xml
* Code Generation with esxml.el
  This library provides to formats for xml code generation.  The primary form is
  esxml.  esxml is the form that is returned by such functions as
  libxml-parse-xml-region and is used internally by emacs in many xml related
  libraries.

** A brief example
  The following is a very simple esxml document, paths are handled directly, via
  a case statement.  While this is not good practice, this is meant to be a very
  simple example.

*** sxml example
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((count 0))
    (defun sxml-demo (httpcon)
      (incf count)
      (case (intern (elnode-http-pathinfo httpcon))
        (/messages (with-current-buffer "*Messages*"
                     (sxml-to-xml `(html (body (pre ,(buffer-string)))))))
  
        (t (sxml-to-xml
            `(html
              (body
               (h1 "Hello from Emacs!") (br)
               "Trying to visit " ,(format "%s" (elnode-http-pathinfo httpcon)) (br)
               "Visit " (a (@ (href "/messages")) "messages") " to see the *Messages* buffer." (br)
               "Have been visited " ,(format "%s" count) " times since last started.")))))))
#+END_SRC 

    This outputs the following HTML:

#+BEGIN_SRC
<html >
  <body >
    <h1 >Hello from Emacs!</h1><br />
    Trying to visit /anywhere<br />
    Visit <a href="/messages">messages</a> to see the *Messages* buffer.<br />
    Have been visited 1 times since last started.
  </body>
</html>
#+END_SRC


*** esxml example
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((count 0))
    (defun esxml-demo (httpcon)
      (incf count)
      (case (intern (elnode-http-pathinfo httpcon))
        (/messages (with-current-buffer "*Messages*"
                     (esxml-to-xml `(html () (body () (pre () ,(buffer-string)))))))
        
        (t (esxml-to-xml
            `(html ()
                   (body ()
                         (h1 () "Hello from Emacs!")
                         (br) "Trying to visit " ,(format "%s" (elnode-http-pathinfo httpcon))
                         (br)  "Visit " (a ((href . "/messages")) "messages")  " to see the *Messages* buffer."
                         (br) "Have been visited " ,(format "%s" count) " times since last started.")))))))
#+END_SRC

** Advanced examples
*** A standard page generator


* Extracting data from HTML and XML documents with esxml-query.el
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'dom)
    (require 'esxml-query)

    (url-retrieve
     "https://schneierfacts.com/"
     (lambda (status &rest args)
       (let* ((html (libxml-parse-html-region url-http-end-of-headers (point-max)))
              (fact (esxml-query "p.fact" html)))
         (message "Did you know: %s" (car (dom-children fact))))))
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'dom)
    (require 'esxml-query)

    (url-retrieve
     "https://www.xkcd.com/rss.xml"
     (lambda (status &rest args)
       (goto-char url-http-end-of-headers)
       (forward-line 1)
       (let* ((xml (libxml-parse-xml-region (point) (point-max)))
              (latest (esxml-query "rss>channel>item" xml))
              (title (car (dom-children (esxml-query "title" latest))))
              (link (car (dom-children (esxml-query "link" latest)))))
         (message "%S: %s" title link))))
  #+END_SRC
